# Application-management-system
The application allows you to view a catalog of applications by category. The user can install the desired applications and then view them by category (Economic, Entertainment, Learning, Social-Media). The user can uninstall the applications he no longer needs. At the same time, he has access to statistics about the number of installed applications by category. At the beginning of the application, the user must be registered to access his applications and the catalog.

You need to unzip "catalog" and "util".
